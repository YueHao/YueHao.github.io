  ABSTRACT={We present a method to compress the 2D transverse phase space projections from a hadron accelerator and use that information to predict the beam transmission. This method assumes that obtaining at least three projections of the 4D transverse phase space is possible and that an accurate simulation model is available for the beamline. Using a simulated model, we show that—a computer can train a convolutional autoencoder to reduce phase-space information which can later be used to predict the beam transmission. Finally, we argue that although using projections from a realistic nonlinear distribution produces less accurate results, the method still generalizes well.}

abstract = {A fast dynamic aperture (DA) optimization method for storage rings has been developed through the use of reversal integration. Even if dynamical systems have an exact reversal symmetry, a numerical forward integration differs from its reversal. For a chaotic trajectory, cumulative round-off errors are scaled, which results in an exponential growth on the difference. The exponential effect is a generic chaos indicator which represents the sensitivity of the chaotic motion to its initial condition. The chaos indicator of the charged particle motion can be obtained by comparing the forward integrations of particle trajectories with corresponding reversals, a.k.a. “backward integrations.” The indicator is observable even through short-term particle tracking simulations. Therefore, adopting it as an objective function could speed up optimization. The DA of the National Synchrotron Light Source II storage ring, and another test diffraction-limited light source ring, were optimized using this method for the purpose of demonstration.}

abstractNote = {The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) Project has entered the phase of beam commissioning starting from the room-temperature front end and the superconducting linac segment of first 15 cryomodules. With the newly commissioned helium refrigeration system supplying 4.5 K liquid helium to the quarter-wave resonators and solenoids, the FRIB accelerator team achieved the sectional key performance parameters as designed ahead of schedule accelerating heavy ion beams above 20 MeV/u energy. Thus, FRIB accelerator becomes world’s highest-energy heavy ion linear accelerator. We also validated machine protection and personnel protection systems that will be crucial to the next phase of commissioning. FRIB is on track towards a national user facility at the power frontier with a beam power two orders of magnitude higher than operating heavy-ion facilities. In this work, we summarize the status of accelerator design, technology development, construction, commissioning as well as path to operations and upgrades.},

This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics over the past decades and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on “Gluons and quark sea at high energies” at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required to achieve them. It has been benefited profoundly from inputs by the users’ communities of BNL and JLab. Furthermore, this White Paper offers the promise to propel the QCD science program in the US, established with the CEBAF accelerator at JLab and the RHIC collider at BNL, to the next QCD frontier.},

	abstract = {The physics programme and the design are described of a new collider for particle and nuclear physics, the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), in which a newly built electron beam of 60 GeV, to possibly 140 GeV, energy collides with the intense hadron beams of the LHC. Compared to the first ep collider, HERA, the kinematic range covered is extended by a factor of twenty in the negative four-momentum squared, Q2, and in the inverse Bjorken x, while with the design luminosity of 1033 cm-2 s-1 the LHeC is projected to exceed the integrated HERA luminosity by two orders of magnitude. The physics programme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing the LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with high precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to investigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak interactions. The LHeC thus continues the path of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) into unknown areas of physics and kinematics. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and electron-ion scattering in a (Q21/x) range extended by four orders of magnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel investigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The LHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics and beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical design considerations on the interaction region, magnets including new dipole prototypes, cryogenics, RF, and further components. A design study is also presented of a detector suitable to perform high precision DIS measurements in a wide range of acceptance using state-of-the art detector technology, which is modular and of limited size enabling its fast installation. The detector includes tagging devices for electron, photon, proton and neutron detection near to the beam pipe. Civil engineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the detector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the LHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It so represents a major opportunity for progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC.}

abstract = {The term “real-estate gradient” is used to describe the energy gain provided by an accelerating structure per actual length it takes in the accelerator. given that the length of the tunnel available for the accelerator is constrained, the real-estate gradient is an important measure of the efficiency of a given accelerator structure. When designing an accelerating cavity to be efficient in this sense, the unwanted Higher Order Mode (HOM) fields should be reduced by suitable HOM dampers. This is a particularly important consideration for high current operation. The additional RF components might take longitude space and reduce the total accelerating efficiency. We describe a new high efficiency 5-cell cavity with the dampers included. The total length of the cavity is reduced by 13% as compared to a more conventional design without compromising the cavity fundamental-mode performance. In addition, the HOM impedance is reduced for a higher Beam-Break-Up (BBU) threshold of operating current. In this paper, we consider an example, a possible application at the eRHIC Energy Recovery Linac (ERL).}

The future ERL-based electron–ion collider eRHIC at BNL is used as an illustrative example. This ERL has multiple high current Superconducting Radiofrequency (SRF) 5-cell cavities. The HOM power generated when a single bunch traverses the cavity is estimated by the corresponding loss factor. Multiple re-circulations through the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) create a specific bunch pattern. In this case the loss factor can be different than the single bunch loss factor. HOM power can vary dramatically when the ERL bunch pattern changes. The HOM power generation can be surveyed in the time and frequency domains. We estimate the average HOM power in a 5-cell cavity with different ERL bunch patterns.},
